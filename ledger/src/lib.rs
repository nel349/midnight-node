//! The Ledger crate provide host functions for the Node runtime
//!
//! We make use of module-parameterization here, an un-intentional feature of Rust
//! See this example code: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/yrihwb/comment/ivuzmgt
//!
//! This means we can use the same code for two different versions of the ledger crate
